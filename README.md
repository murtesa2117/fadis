# Islam Youth Group Website

## Overview
This is a simple static website for the Islam Youth Group. The website has two primary features:
1. A registration link that allows new members to sign up.
2. A password-protected page containing the groupâ€™s privacy and rules.

## Features
- **Welcome Banner**: Displays a welcome message.
- **Image Button**: Clicking this prompts the user for a password. If entered correctly, it leads to the privacy and rules page.
- **Registration Button**: Takes users directly to the registration form.

## Instructions
1. **To Run the Website**:
   - Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

2. **Background Image**:
   - The background image is located in the `background.jpg` file.

3. **Button Image**:
   - The image used for the button is located in the `button_image.png` file.

## How It Works
- The image button asks for a password (`All@fadis2117`). If the correct password is entered, the user is redirected to a privacy page.
- The privacy page includes rules and a link to view users who have registered.

## Notes
- The website is fully responsive and can be viewed on mobile devices.
- Ensure that all files remain in the same directory when running the website.
